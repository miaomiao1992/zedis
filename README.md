## 📖 Introduction

**Zedis** is a next-generation Redis GUI client designed for developers who demand speed. 

Unlike Electron-based clients that can feel sluggish with large datasets, Zedis is built on **GPUI** (the same rendering engine powering the [Zed Editor](https://zed.dev)). This ensures a native, 60 FPS experience with minimal memory footprint, even when browsing millions of keys.

## 📦 Installation

### macOS
The recommended way to install Zedis is via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask zedis
```

### Windows

```bash
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install zedis
```

### Arch linux

```bash
yay -S zedis-bin
```


## ✨ Features

### 🚀 Blazing Fast
- **GPU Rendering**: All UI elements are rendered on the GPU for buttery smooth performance.
- **Virtual List**: Efficiently handle lists with 100k+ keys using virtual scrolling and `SCAN` iteration.

### 🧠 Smart Data Viewer
Zedis automatically detects content types (`ViewerMode::Auto`) and renders them in the most useful format:
- **Automatic Decompression**: Transparently detects and decompresses **LZ4**, **SNAPPY**, **GZIP**, and **ZSTD** data (e.g., compressed JSON is automatically unpacked and pretty-printed).
- **JSON**: Automatic **pretty-printing** with full **syntax highlighting**.
- **MessagePack**: Deserializes binary MsgPack data into a readable JSON-like format.
- **Images**: Native preview for stored images (`PNG`, `JPG`, `WEBP`, `SVG`, `GIF`).
- **Hex View**: Adaptive 8/16-byte hex dump for analyzing raw binary data.
- **Text**: UTF-8 validation with large text support.

### 🛡️ Safety & Security
- **Read-only Mode**: Mark connections as **Read-only** to prevent accidental writes or deletions. Perfect for inspecting production environments with total peace of mind.
- **SSH Tunneling**: Securely access private Redis instances via bastion hosts. Supports authentication via Password, Private Key, and SSH Agent.
- **TLS/SSL**: Full support for encrypted connections, including custom CA, Client Certificates, and Private Keys.

### ⚡ Productivity
- **Search History**: Automatically records your search queries locally. History is **connection-scoped**, ensuring production queries never pollute your local development workflow.
- **Quick Recall**: Instantly access recent keywords via a smart dropdown, speeding up your debugging sessions.

### 🎨 Modern Experience
- **Cross-Platform**: Powered by GPUI, Zedis delivers a consistent, native experience across **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**.
- **Smart Topology Detection**: Automatically identifies **Standalone**, **Cluster**, or **Sentinel** modes. Connect to any node, and Zedis handles the topology mapping automatically.
- **Themes**: Pre-loaded with **Light**, **Dark**, and **System** themes.
- **I18n**: Full support for **English** and **Chinese (Simplified)**.
- **Responsive**: Split-pane layout that adapts to any window size.

🚧 Development Status

Zedis is currently in early active development. To maintain development velocity and architectural flexibility, we are not accepting Pull Requests at this time.
